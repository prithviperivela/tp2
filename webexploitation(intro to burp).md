# Intro to Burp
Try [here](http://titan.picoctf.net:49526/) to find the flag

**FLAG: picoCTF{#0TP_Bypvss_SuCc3$S_e1eb16ed}**

## My approach to this challenge:- 
Launching the instance of this challenge gives a registration website. I looked into the code of the website using inspect element but didnot find any thing interesting except that the form we are filling is sent using the POST method.

Looking into the hints , I found out that this challenge can be solved by intercepting the requests and modifying the http traffic. The second hint says that we can get the flag by spoiling or damaging the code.

I thus opened Burp proxy. Here, I opened an new project and opened the challenge website in burpsuite browser. we can intercept traffic using intercept on/ off button in the proxy window. 
First, I tried various inputs for registration but all of them led to the same 2fa authentication page. Here, I put a random number, clicked submit and forwarded the response.The page said Invalid otp. Redoing again, in the intercepted request, we can see a variable `OTP` which is responsible for the authentication. I thought what if this variable doesnt exist and deleted it. Now forwarding the request to the browser gives us the flag.
